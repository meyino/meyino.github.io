# Privacy Policy for VideoInfo

*Last updated: February 2025*

This Privacy Policy describes how the VideoInfo app ("we", "our", or "the app") handles information when you use our application on your Android device. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## 1. Information We Collect

VideoInfo is designed to work locally on your device:

- **Media files you select:** When you choose a video or image file through the system file picker, the app reads only that file (and its metadata, such as resolution, codec, duration, EXIF data) to display information to you. We do not collect, store, or transmit the contents of your files to any server.
- **App preferences:** Settings you choose inside the app (for example, language) may be stored locally on your device. This data stays on your device and is not sent to us.

## 2. How We Use Information

Any data accessed by the app is used only to:

- Show you technical information about the video or image you selected (e.g., format, resolution, duration, metadata).
- Remember your in-app preferences on your device.

We do not use your data for advertising, analytics, or any purpose other than providing the app's functionality.

## 3. Data Storage and Processing

All processing of your selected media and preferences happens on your device. We do not operate servers that collect or store your personal data. Your video and image files are not uploaded or sent to us or any third party.

## 4. Third-Party Services

VideoInfo does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking libraries. The app is distributed through Google Play; your use of Google Play is subject to Google's own privacy policy, which we do not control.

## 5. Permissions

The app may request access only to the specific files you choose via the Android system file picker. We do not access your entire storage or other apps' data without your explicit selection.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Our app does not knowingly collect personal information from children. The app does not require registration or collection of personal data.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will be revised when changes are made. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
